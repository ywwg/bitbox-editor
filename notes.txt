ok so things I want to do:

* rename recorded wav files and move them to a subdir
* play back those files so I know what they are
* do it preset by preset
* reordering presets
* detect recordings not used by presets and delete them (audio confirmation of course)
* rewrite XML
* maybe some standard XML toggles like exclusive mode or auto record, etc?

basic blocks:

* python3!
* a python-prompt-toolkit dispatcher that handles commands
* a way to play back wav files -- simpleaudio looks fine
* reading the XML into a convenient object
 * serializing the XML back out in a way that bitbox can still read
* operations on the xml:
 * rename file (calls to fs operations to do move, dir create)
 * swap or reorder presets (plz type the new order using existing indexes...)
* filesystem operation module

so easiest to start with XML reader and wave player
then add xml writing
then add preset reordering
then add wave file rename
